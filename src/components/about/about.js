              My name is James Kubitz. Iâ€™m an ambitious web developer who is actively seeking to
              improve my skillset. I am eager to continuously learn about my
              field of study and stay up to date with the latest technologies,
              often spending hours conducting independent research and teaching myself.
              Programming is a passion of mine as I enjoy the satisfaction of turning a concept into
              reality, taking pride in the finished product.
